# Pixel Art Maker

This is a web page project that offers a functional color palette for creating pixel art. The main skills involved are DOM manipulation, using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Skills and Development

**Skills:**
- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript manipulation

**Development:**
We implemented a color palette using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, allowing you to create pixel art.

## Project Requirements

1. **Title "Color Palette"**
   - We added an `<h1>` element with the id `title` containing the title "Color Palette".

2. **Color Palette**
   - We created a color palette with four distinct colors.
   - Each color has the class `color`.
   - The color palette does not include the color white.
   - The colors are displayed side by side below the title "Color Palette".
   - Each color has a solid black border.
   
3. **Addition of Black Color**
   - The black color is the first color in the palette.

4. **Pixel Board**
   - We added a pixel board with 25 pixels (5x5).
   - Each pixel has the class `pixel`.
   - The initial color of the pixels is white.
   - The pixel board is displayed below the color palette.

5. **Pixel Dimensions**
   - Each pixel has a width and height of 40 pixels.
   - Each pixel is bordered by a 1-pixel black border.

6. **Initial Color Selection**
   - Black color is initially selected to paint the pixels.

7. **Color Selection in Palette**
   - Clicking on a color in the palette selects it to fill the pixels.
   - Only one color from the palette can be selected at a time.

8. **Painting Pixels**
   - After selecting a color in the palette, it is possible to paint the pixels of the board with that color.

9. **Clear Button**
   - We added a button with the id `clear-board` between the color palette and the pixel board.
   - Clicking the button clears the pixel board, filling it with white.

We hope you enjoy creating your pixel art masterpieces with this editor! ðŸŽ¨
